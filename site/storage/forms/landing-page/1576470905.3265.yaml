business_name: 'I just joined an internet marketing company and have to get all the software I need and go through all the coaching and guidelines and in those processes I will be naming a d opening accounts.  One step at a time. Their company getting us going is Job-System.Org...  I also have to get an suv so I can go to the store when I need to instead of walking, I have been sick for two months now from having to walk everywhere I need to go but my one friend always asks me to watch her babies so she can go to the store, and I fold her clothes that are there and change the washer and dryer but she doesn''t offer for me to do mine.  I wand to go get all of my belongings from storage where one place is charging me triple every other month and I  cannot do anything about it from here, my stuff is in FL because of Hurricane Micheal and I have other stuff in Mississippi  due to Hurricane Katrina and I was hoping to have all of my life in one place a gain. I want to move to a better place that has a wash/dry hookup  and the hot water heater works right and the heater works right and the stairs aren''t dangerous. Sorry this is not what you wanted to hear but'
