One Park Financial, a leading capital provider to small and mid-sized businesses, announced today that it closed a $30 million financing facility from a New York-based alternative investment firm. The funding will be used to further expand One Park Financial's technology-enabled platform to offer a wide variety of flexible financing and funding options to business owners across the country. It is the largest credit facility for One Park Financial to date and reflects the successful expansion of the company's efforts.

For years One Park Financial has offered a hassle-free and efficient process of securing business capital without the obstacles associated with traditional bank financing. One Park Financial has the advantage of offering a variety of strategic capital options optimized for the merchant. The South Florida company strives to build long-lasting relationships with each merchant it works with by providing a personal touch and access to the best rates and terms.

"Our technology-enabled algorithms help us underwrite in real-time which gives us an advantage over banks," says John Lie-Nielsen, CEO of One Park Financial. "We make underwriting decisions in minutes whereas banks may take days or even weeks to decide. Our goal is to help small businesses secure capital, quickly and efficiently."

Added Ben McCrery, President of One Park, "our use of technology also allows us to look beyond traditional underwriting methods to determine the credit worthiness of a potential borrower."
