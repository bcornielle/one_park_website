One Park Financial partnered alongside the United Way and Coconut Grove BID to host a fun trick or treating event for local underprivileged children. 50 children were brought to the Mayfair offices and treated to a pizza party before embarking on their candy collecting tour. Groups of children visited participating offices one by one to collect candy, play carnival games and see a haunted house! One Park Financial wanted to give these children a safe place to trick or treat since so many aren't able to around their neighborhoods. Check out some of the pictures from the event below!
