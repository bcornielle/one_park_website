**MIAMI, FL** – February 10, 2020 – One Park Financial is proud to announce that it has again been named one of the “Best and Brightest Companies to Work for in The Nation” by the National Association for Business Resources.  Only 540 national winners were selected from 5,000 nominations. 

“This achievement means even more than it did a year ago. As we continue to raise the bar, these companies rise to the challenge,” said [Jennifer Kluge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-kluge-6395424/), president and CEO, Best and Brightest Programs.

The competition identifies and honors companies that deliver exceptional human resource practices and a remarkable commitment to their employees. Organizations are assessed based on categories such as communication, work-life balance, employee education, diversity, recognition, retention and other critical employee-centric issues, according to the Association.  All companies are assessed by an independent research firm.

“We know that hiring the best people is the best way to build our business success. Our employees work hard to make sure that acquiring funding is an easy, accessible process for small business owners.” says One Park Financial’s President and Co-Founder [Ben McCrery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benmccrery/).

The company recently launched a [“Dream Weaver” program](https://www.oneparkfinancial.com/press/one-park-financial-makes-employees-dreams-come-true-with-dream-weaver-program) to make employees dreams come true. Among the wishes granted by Dream Weaver are funding for a local kids sport team (thanks to a request from an employee who coaches the team), a car for an employee who has an exceptionally long commute, and kids’ bedroom furniture from an employee who wanted to make her little ones more comfortable at home. 

“One Park Financial’s core values played a key role in the company being named as ‘Best and Brightest’,” says One Park Financial's CEO [John Lie-Nielsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benmccrery/).  “We focus on delivering Positive Results, Client Success, Taking Risks and Having Fun. These values encourage every member of our team to work hard, achieve success and have a great time doing it.”
