## One Park Financial Helps Santa Deliver Smiles Supporting Nicklaus Children’s Hospital’s “Spread Joy” Toy Drive
<br> 
**COCONUT GROVE, Fla.** - Dec 27, 2019:  One Park Financial, a Miami-based financial technology firm and small business funding facilitator, helped bring a little holiday happiness to children at the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital. 

Hospitals nationwide often depend on holiday generosity to help supply their patients with gifts and a little joy. In an effort to help the patients and their families spending the holidays in the hospital, One Park Financial collected toys for Nicklaus Children’s Hospital’s Spread Joy Toy Drive.

“The toy drive is an event we’re proud to support,” says One Park Financial’s CEO [John Lie-Nielsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-lie-nielsen-9304243/). “It’s great to be able to help [Nicklaus Children’s Hospital](https://www.mchf.org/?gclid=CjwKCAiA9JbwBRAAEiwAnWa4Q8nV0nYlYgKZAHBdZMX_U0LgUCSxY5DouBrY-UJESztPzeShdVR9URoCGngQAvD_BwE) make their patients’ lives a little brighter during this special time of year.”

[One Park Financial](www.oneparkfinancial.com) partnered with other local businesses including Sony Latin Music, MCA Academy, Marca Miami, and Virgin Hotels to collect toys for kids ranging in age from infants to teenagers. Collectively, we were able to gather over 300 toys and happily delivered them to Nicklaus Children’s Hospital just before Christmas.

This holiday season marks the third time that One Park Financial participated in the Spread Joy Toy Drive, along with other events to benefit Nicklaus Children’s Hospital, South Florida's only licensed specialty hospital exclusively for children. Lie-Nielsen also sits on the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital Board of Directors, chairs its marketing committee and sits on the finance subcommittee. 

“Partnerships like the one with One Park Financial allow members of the community an opportunity to give back to the patients at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital,” said[ Michelle Boggs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-boggs-45bb9114/), President of Nicklaus Children’s Hospital Foundation.

One Park Financial encourages employees to work with the local community in whatever ways they choose to contribute. As a company, we host community events and collect donations year-round for both the United Way and Nicklaus Children's Hospital.
