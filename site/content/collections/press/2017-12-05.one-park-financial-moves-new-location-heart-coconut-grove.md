One Park Financial, a leader in providing capital to small and mid-sized businesses, has announced they will be moving their office to a larger facility in the historic Mayfair building in Coconut Grove.  For many years, One Park Financial has been offering businesses a hassle-free and extremely efficient process of securing business capital without the headache associated with traditional bank financing. The goal is and always has been to help entrepreneurs win and get the financing they need. This move comes at a perfect time as the company continues to expand. The move is effective December 19<sup>th</sup>, 2016.

The move was necessitated by the significant growth that the company has been seeing in the last few years. In the past year alone the company has grown 300% and doubled its employee base. “I’ve been a long time resident of the Grove and I’m excited to move our team to such a great area. We’ve grown so much in the past year that it was time for a move. A new chapter for One Park Financial is beginning and with such a motivated team behind us, I have no doubts it will be a successful one,” says CEO &amp; Co-Founder John Lie-Nielsen.

The new 7500 square foot office sits on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of the beautiful Mayfair building overlooking Coconut Grove. The workplace will have 3 main offices, 2 conference rooms and 50 workstations that compliment a unique floorplan designed to promote worker productivity in a collaborative environment. One Park Financial’s new neighbors include Advansis Media, Blonde Tulip Bistro, Constec Realty, Delivery Dude and Crispin Porter + Bogusky. Employees will also be walking distance from great spots such as Greenstreet Café, Lokal, The Spillover and Panther Coffee and only a short walk away from beautiful parks directly on Biscayne Bay.

“We couldn’t be happier with our new location in Coconut Grove.  We think the unique design and premium location will help us attract the best talent in Miami Dade.  As we continue to grow exponentially, this is critical,” says President and Co-Founder Ben McCrery.
