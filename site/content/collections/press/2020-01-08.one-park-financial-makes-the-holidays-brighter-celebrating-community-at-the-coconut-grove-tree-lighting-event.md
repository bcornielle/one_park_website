### One Park Financial Makes the Holidays Brighter Celebrating Community at The Coconut Grove Tree Lighting Event
<br> 

**COCONUT GROVE, Fla.** – Jan 8, 2019 - For one evening in December, Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood was transformed into a winter wonderland. 

One Park Financial, a Miami-based financial technology firm and [small business funding](http://www.oneparkfinancial.com) facilitator, was one of the local companies that helped make the magic happen at the Grove’s 7th Annual Holiday Tree Lighting Ceremony.

One Park Financial sponsored 10 trees for the event, which was organized by the [Coconut Grove Business Improvement District (BID) ](http://www.coconutgrove.com)and took place on Sunday, Dec. 8 in the Grove’s Commodore Plaza. Dozens of Christmas trees were donated to local families in need.
Event attendees also got to visit Santa in his cozy cabin for photos, explore a pop-up Holiday Village featuring miniature replicas of local restaurants and retailers, and vote for the best decorated store. Local bands played music ranging from Bahamian to classic, carols to jazz. Kids could join Olaf the Snowman to celebrate with seasonal art including face painting, ornament decorating, and temporary tattooing.

“It was great seeing people enjoying what the neighborhood has to offer. Coconut Grove is a really special place, we even call our team members “Grovies” to reflect how much we appreciate and support this community.” says One Park Financial's CEO [John Lie-Nielsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-lie-nielsen-9304243/). “This event is a perfect example of how important it is to support local businesses like the many amazing small companies in Coconut Grove; they help to build and sustain unique, thriving communities.”
