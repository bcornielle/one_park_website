<p>Almost half of the small businesses in the US are owned by women, and female entrepreneurs are launching businesses at double the rate of male entrepreneurs. there are now more than 12.3 million women-owned businesses in the U.S. Over the last decade, the number of women-owned businesses has increased by 58 percent. But funding isn&rsquo;t keeping up with the growth of women-owned businesses.</p>
<p>There is plenty of government and community support for female entrepreneurs, but a lot of the traditional funding sources require perfect credit to qualify for a loan or line of credit. Women tends to assume that they won&rsquo;t get funded when they start their businesses, and statistics back that up. According to the <a href="https://www.nawbo.org/about">National Association of Women Business Owners</a>, nearly 25% of female business owners don&rsquo;t bother to apply for traditional business loans because they don&rsquo;t think will approved &ndash; and not without reason: women-owned companies are 15-20% less likely to get a loan than male-owned businesses.</p>
<h2>Bad Credit Business Loans </h2>
<p>Convincing a bank to approve a loan to your small business has never been easy, no matter whether you are a man or a woman. Banks don&rsquo;t like risks, and they like to make money. Small businesses are a risk, because they don&rsquo;t have the same bail-out options as a big business does. And small businesses tend to ask for small loans, when compared to the amounts big businesses borrow. Since the amount of work associated with lending funds is the same no matter what amount is borrowed, banks would prefer to lend huge amounts to big businesses. It&rsquo;s easier, it&rsquo;s safer, and it&rsquo;s profitable.</p>
<p>A female entrepreneur still might be able to get a loan based on personal credit ratings, collateral available to secure the loan, business history and anticipated performance and other factors. But if your credit rating isn&rsquo;t in the 700+ zone &ndash; you&rsquo;re not going to get a bank loan (and that especially includes Small Business Administration backed loans). But you still have options.</p>
<h2>Working Capital Help for Women-Owned Businesses</h2>
<p>If your personal credit is low (under 600), you have to find other ways to convince funders to take a risk and loan you money. A solid business plan helps, and so does networking. You should also apply for a DUNS number, so that you can establish a business credit history and access your business credit report from&nbsp;<a href="https://iupdate.dnb.com/iUpdate/viewiUpdateHome.htm;jsessionid=A9C87768E3F759B25ADE4330A2D1BE0F.app2">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</a>. Plus, once you have a DUNS number, you can apply for small business grants listed on <a href="http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html">Grants.gov</a>, a database of federally sponsored grants. When you have your DUNs, you can register to do business with the U.S. government through its System Award Management&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/?portal:componentId=9615a076-c195-44d7-9bf4-ff1d3d101e6c&amp;interactionstate=JBPNS_rO0ABXc0ABBfanNmQnJpZGdlVmlld0lkAAAAAQATL2pzZi9uYXZpZ2F0aW9uLmpzcAAHX19FT0ZfXw**&amp;portal:type=action##11">website</a>, and then create an account at Grants.gov.</p>
<p>Options such as Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) Federal Contracting program can provide help in accessing work from the federal government, if you meet the pre-qualification <a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/women-owned-small-business-federal-contracting-program">requirements</a>. The Small Business Administration offers workshops and networking <a href="https://www.sba.gov/tools/events">events</a> that can educate you on business best practices and open the doors to new opportunities. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nwbc.gov/">National Women&rsquo;s Business Council</a>, a non-partisan federal advisory council, also holds in-person and online networking<a href="https://www.nwbc.gov/category/events/"> events</a>. Google for other networking and training opportunities near you.</p>
<p>You can meet with business mentors at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance/">local SBA resource center</a>&nbsp;if you need help understanding funding options and how to prepare your application package for a bank loan.</p>
