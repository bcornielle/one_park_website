No matter how bad the situation appears, the way that you handle the challenge will have long-term effects on your business.

<b>Start With the Mind </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying calm during tough financial times is one of the earmark qualities of successful CEOs. The ability to think straight and tackle the problem with sound logic and reasoning is invaluable to a company. If you're already sinking from a punctured boat, you don't want to panic and make poor decisions, causing the boat to sink faster. Maintaining a calm perspective allows you to think of effective solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . </span>

<b>Know Who to Trust</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the many definitions of what a company is, a "combination of people and culture" is perhaps the most sensible and relatable definition. Thus, the biggest financial difficulties should be embraced by both you and the people whom you trust. Family and friends, for instance, can give you a motivational boost during the lows of your business pursuit. Know who you can trust inside the company, both employees and partners. This way, you know who to share a big financial crisis to without necessarily causing chaos and unease throughout your whole workforce. </span>

<b>Have a Plan B</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a "Plan A" is good business management practice, but what if it fails? Having a secondary plan secures the continuity of a business. For instance, if your Plan A is to liquidate assets when working capital is dwindling, what if the amount you come up with is insufficient? Plan B can involve preparing a list of lenders that you can get the best possible loan terms from. Lenders, such as [One Park Financial](https://www.oneparkfinancial.com/), can provide the capital you need to continue running operations. Whether you have bad or no credit, the institution promises a solution for your financial problem. </span>

<b>Take Baby Steps</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Business owners should avoid taking great risks during dire times. Take a step back, reevaluate, and then take baby steps towards extinguishing the fire. Identify what you can reasonably and quickly achieve within this week and the next. Once you achieve that milestone, work on another part of the problem. For instance, if a big box store that constitutes a large percentage of your monthly orders discontinues their relationship with you, avoid panicking in search of a new big box store that will take you in. Instead, try to sell off as much inventory as you can through other sales channels so you have some [money to get](https://www.oneparkfinancial.com/pre-qualification) by until you locate another big box client. </span>

<b>Harness the Power of Technology</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the toughest financial difficulties will look simpler to tackle when you use software to map and parse it into smaller pieces. A good example of how technology is helping businesses address financial problems is through the use of mobile devices, which today is equally as impressive as their bulkier desktop and laptop counterparts. Tablets and android phones enable a workforce to work outside the office thereby [minimizing overhead expenses](https://www.oneparkfinancial.com/blog/going-green-can-benefit-small-business). Moreover, tax accounting software, such as Intuit, help businesses straighten out their finances and prepare for tax filing with absolute precision and convenience. The likelihood of making tax filing errors that can come back to haunt you is lower. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial problems of exceptional magnitude can seem like the last thing you'd want to encounter as a business owner. But as much as they can hurt the company, these events can actually help you become a better leader and make your company more resilient to future problems. By taking the five steps aforementioned in this article, the entire company will come out of a difficult situation stronger and ready to tackle more challenging problems.</span>
