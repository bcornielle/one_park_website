Short-term business loans act as a fast cash solution that helps you manage cash-flow gaps and other immediate financing needs. They work the same as any other term loan, the borrower gets a one-time lump sum which is repaid, with interest and any applicable fees, within a set period of time &ndash; the term. Short-term loans are typically paid back within a year or less, while long-term loan terms usually have multiple-year repayment terms.</p>
<p>As a small business owner, you typically have a better chance of being approved for a short-term loan from a bank than you would a long-term loan. The shorter the repayment term, the less risk to the lender.</p>
<H2>Do I qualify for a short-term loan?</H2>
<p>If you are applying for a loan from a bank or credit union, you&rsquo;re more likely to be approved if you have a good personal credit score &ndash; 720 and up. Your business should have earned healthy revenues for the last 3-5 years.</p>
<p>With a credit score of less than 720, you will definitely need collateral to qualify for a short-term loan from a bank. Those with excellent credit history, or an established relationship with a banker at your credit union or local bank, may qualify for an unsecured loan.</p>
<p>Bad credit or no credit? You&rsquo;ll likely find short-term loans &ndash; any loans, really &ndash; from a bank difficult to access. You may qualify if you can deposit the amount of the requested loan in a secured savings account. It sounds counterintuitive &ndash; if you had the money, why would you need a loan? &ndash; but you may be able to get a friend or family member to loan you the necessary sum if they know it will just be used as security for as short-term loan. And if you do have the money to secure a loan, it&rsquo;s a great way to build your credit history.</p>
<H2>What can I do with a short-term loan?</H2>
<p>Short-term small business loans provide funds to address an immediate, temporary financial issue. Some examples include:</p>
<ul style="list-style:circle;padding-left:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<li>You may need a short-term loan to improve your cash flow during slow periods to help you meet payroll and pay bills.</li>
<li>You may need to hire additional temporary help during the holiday season, or during other periods when your business peaks.</li>
<li>You may need to manage the financial consequences of an emergency, such as equipment breakdowns, theft or a natural disaster.</li>
<li>Or you may want to take advantage of a sudden opportunity or may have a new offer that requires you to upgrade your business capacities or inventory quickly.</li>
<li>You may need to fill a cash flow gap between your account receivables and payables.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Where can I get a short-term small business loan?</H2>
<p><strong>Banks and Credit unions - </strong>Be aware that even if you meet the criteria, you&rsquo;ll need to devote a lot of time to preparing your loan application and waiting to find out if you&rsquo;ve been approved. If you need funds quickly, a bank or credit union may not be the best option. If you have an existing professional relationship with a financial institution though, you may be able to expedite the process &ndash; talk to your banker.</p>
<p><strong>Small Business Administration - </strong>SBA loans are a great choice if you have an excellent credit history and time. These loans aren&rsquo;t easy to qualify for, and typically require significant documentation. But if you can plan ahead and have a strong credit history, SBA loans &ndash; which are funded by banks and credit unions and guaranteed by the SBA &ndash; are a great choice as rates tend to be low.</p>
<p><strong>Line of credit - </strong>If you have existing credit, have collateral that you can use to secure a one-time increase in your credit line, and a great credit history its worth exploring this option with your bank or credit union. This can be the fastest way to obtain a short-term loan quickly.</p>
