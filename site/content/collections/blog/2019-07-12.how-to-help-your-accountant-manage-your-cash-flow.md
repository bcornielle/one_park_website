By allowing a professional to implement strategies and measure results, you’re free to concentrate on running your business and serving your customers. 

However, your accountant shouldn’t be completely on their own. The more information, access and general help you can provide, the more successfully your cash flow can be managed. Here’s how to find an accountant and what they can do to help you.  

### 1. Contact an Accountant in the Early Stages of Business Development

Accountants are often more affordable than many business owners realize. You don’t have to hire an accountant on your staff or keep one on retainer. Instead, you can visit an accountant for one-time services as needed. Common services provided include:

•	Business plan review

•	Taxes and tax audit services

•	Help with loan applications

An accountant can help you handle any complex financial issues which you don’t understand. But an accountant is also useful for completing simpler stuff which you do understand, such as basic tax stuff. Hiring an accountant frees up your time to run your business.

•	Arranging payments to supplies and partners

You can track your cash flow yourself, but an accountant will likely be more accurate. Ideally, your business is large enough for an in-house accounting team, as they’ll be able to understand the ins and outs of your specific business.

However, you can also hire an accountant to help you develop a cash flow plan. They can organize payments with vendors and clients. For the most part, you can then run your business according to the created plan. If problems develop, you can then contact the accountant for help.  

4. Follow Your Accountant’s Advice

A general expense forecast can easily be created by analyzing costs such as overhead bills, payroll, investments and other costs. Forecasting helps you prepare for leans times and unique expenses to ensure your cash flow remains positive. 

Of course, your accountant needs accurate information in order to develop accurate cash flow forecasts. Help your accountant manage your cash flow by always providing thorough, accurate information about your business as well as your plans for the future.  

Additionally, don’t be afraid to ask questions. A great accountant should be able to explain complicated financial information to you in a simple, common sense way.
