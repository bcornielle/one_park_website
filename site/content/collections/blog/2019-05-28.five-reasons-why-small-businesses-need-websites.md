It doesn’t matter what product you sell, how much revenue you generate each quarter, or how great your reputation is if you’re running a small business, it’s imperative you have a website. 

The thought of “building” a website from scratch can scare even the most seasoned of small business owners, but with the over saturation of website builders out there (it doesn’t get any easier than drag and drop templates), even a novice can quickly assemble a decent business website nowadays. 

Even if you need a more customized site that requires the coding expertise of a website designer, there are plenty of freelancers and digital agencies that can build you a fully functional website at an affordable price point. 

With so many options out there, there’s really no good excuse as to why your small business doesn’t have a website, and quite frankly, it can be to your detriment if you’ve been delaying getting one. 

### 5 reasons why you need a website for your small business  

Every business needs a website no matter their size. A website establishes an [online presence for your business](https://www.oneparkfinancial.com/blog/marketing-mistakes-to-avoid) and can serve a variety of beneficial functions. Let’s take a look at five reasons why every small business needs a website. 

**1)	All of your competitors have websites**

Go ahead and check. There’s a good chance all of your competitors have a website which puts you at a distinct disadvantage in the pecking order. Today’s consumers are more buyer savvy, meaning they often do research prior to taking out their credit cards. 

If you don’t provide an online space where your customers can find testimonials, view your product/service offering, and find educational material about your business then they’ll go elsewhere. 

Having a website helps to keep small businesses competitive and improves their chances of attracting and retaining customers.  

**2)	Marketing**

Not too long-ago small businesses relied primarily upon billboards, newspaper ads, flyers, posters, radio shout outs, and television commercials to promote their business. While traditional marketing hasn’t completely phased out of the picture just yet, no can question that digital marketing now reigns supreme. 

A business website can significantly improve your digital marketing endeavors, especially if you optimize it for SEO (search engine optimization). Once your SEO kicks in (it takes time to rank well on Google), you’ll be guaranteed a flow of steady, organic traffic. That means your website is more visible overall, which should significantly aid you in your marketing efforts.

**3)	A website provides social proof**

Social proof comes in many forms – social media, word of mouth, influencers, reviews, etc. The more social proof you have, the more credibility your business generates. One of the benefits of a website is that you can provide social proof by prominently displaying customer testimonials. 

When customers can see how your product/service has benefited others they will be more inclined to take a chance with your business. 

**4)	You control how the world views your brand**

It’s fantastic when you have Yelp reviews and other online review sites to boost the credibility of your business, but that also means you’re allowing others to shape how the world perceives your brand. 

A website allows you to have a direct influence of how your brand is viewed. You can control what’s posted about your business, state your goals, and provide educational material that positions you as the go-to authority in your niche. 

It also helps that you control the physical appearance of your site such as fonts, colors, and logo. Control is the key word here, and you get plenty of it when you have your own website. 

**5)	It’s expected from your customers** 

Your digital-savvy customers don’t have time to waste on a business that can’t bother to have a website. Online consumers expect you to have one, whether it’s good or not (that’s a conversation for another day).

A website builds trust and gives validation that your business is legitimate. The buyer's journey often starts with piquing interest and building trust. The mere act of having a website builds that foundation.

Just think of your website as a digital business card. When you give someone a business card, it shows legitimacy and lowers barriers. Plus, you certainly don’t want to disappoint your customer’s expectations! 

Don’t delay building a website for your business 

There really is no excuse for not having a website for your business. Online website builders such as Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly make website building a breeze. If you don’t mind putting in more work on your site you can purchase hosting on Bluehost or Go Daddy and opt for a WordPress website. 

If you’re willing to invest serious money into your site and deliver a truly great experience for your customers you can always reach out to a website designer or web design agency to help you build your dream site.
