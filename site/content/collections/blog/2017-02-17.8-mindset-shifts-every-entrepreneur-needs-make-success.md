Owning a business and running it successfully is hard work. If you’ve just started your own business or have been running one for quite some time, you probably know by now that staying motivated to continue is tough as well.<span id="more-30474"></span>

But being motivated to run your business is <em><strong>essential</strong></em> if you want to succeed! If you find yourself running out of patience and wondering what prompted you to venture into entrepreneurship, help is at hand.
<h6>Read on for some tips that can keep you motivated:</h6>

<h2><b>1. Money isn’t everything</b></h2>
Yes, you need money to get your business up and running, but money isn’t everything! Most importantly, you need to have <em><strong>clear goals</strong></em> and a strong desire to succeed. You also need to be focused and determined to take your business to <em>new heights</em>.

At the same time, accumulating as much wealth as possible doesn’t always <em><strong>translate into success.</strong></em> Note that money will <em>motivate</em> you to an extent but it will cease to be important once your basic needs are met. So ascertain what your minimum needs are and concentrate on building a sustainable business.

In the end, you will be more <strong><em>driven by challenges</em></strong> than the urge to make more money!
<blockquote>“Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm”. – <strong>Winston Churchill</strong></blockquote>
<h2><b>2. Imagine good things</b></h2>
More often than not, <em>what you imagine can transform into reality.</em> So whenever you’re faced with a tough situation, avoid negative thoughts and think of the best that can happen to you.

<em><strong>Be positive and distance yourself from negativity.</strong></em> Instead of saying ‘<em>I can’t</em>’, develop a can-do attitude. Think of problems as an opportunity or a challenge and your <em>subconscious</em> will automatically work on <em><strong>positive solutions.</strong></em>

<h2><b>3. Don’t turn away from reality</b></h2>
Note that there’s a <em>difference</em> between fantasizing and thinking positive. When you set unrealistic expectations, focusing on the positive can actually become <em>self-destructive</em>.

Further, stop pretending that everything is fine. Turning a blind eye to the problems in your business or seeing things with rose-colored glasses on won’t help you. Be <em><strong>truthful to yourself</strong></em> and realistic in tough times instead of simply assuming that things will get better.

This doesn’t mean that you <em><strong>doubt your abilities</strong></em> or lose hope; acknowledging reality no matter how harsh it is will only help you find the best solution.

<h2><b>4. Take positive action</b></h2>
Just thinking in the right direction or being positive isn’t enough; you also have to take positive action<a href="http://addicted2success.com/life/10-actions-you-can-take-that-will-dramatically-change-your-life/">.</a> For example, if you say to yourself that you’ll concentrate on driving safely but refuse to put on your seatbelt, your positive thinking won’t be of any use.

<em><strong>Always put-in adequate efforts to succeed, never underestimate the importance of hard work, and anticipate obstacles that you’re likely to face.</strong></em> Additionally, remember to maintain a positive attitude even when you don’t see the desired outcome.

<h2><b>5. Grab opportunities</b></h2>
You never know which <em><strong>opportunity</strong></em> will work in your favor. Perhaps the opportunity you’re trying to pass up because you’re overestimating your importance can help your business immensely. So don’t be embarrassed by the opportunities that come your way; <em><strong>grab them with both hands and focus on giving your best shot every time.</strong></em>

Don’t wait for an opportunity to come your way! What if an opportunity never comes by? A good opportunity might be <em>right in front of your eyes</em> and you might not be able to see it.

Being open-minded and calm, and visualizing your goals will help you be aware of opportunities. Changing your mindset will also help you conceive new ideas and create opportunities where there are none.

<h2><b>6. Hold yourself accountable</b></h2>
For your successes as well as failures! A lot of people crave the <em>independence that entrepreneurship provides</em> but few are willing to acknowledge that owning a business means <em><strong>being accountable</strong></em> for each and everything.

As an entrepreneur, you will be responsible for all the decisions you make; <em>blaming your subordinates won’t be an option.</em> Take the blame for failures but don’t dwell a lot on them and always <strong><em>rejoice</em></strong> when you taste success!

<h2><b>7. Count your blessings</b></h2>
When things don’t work out the way you want them to, it’s easy to be upset. <em>Counting your blessings</em> in times of distress and expressing gratitude for the smallest of things can bring a <em><strong>smile to your face.</strong></em>

Consider how your last job was and how far you’ve come, be thankful for the food you eat, the roof over your head, and the car you drive, and think of your family and the love you share. <em><strong>There’s definitely a lot in your life to be happy about than sulk over business losses or failures.</strong></em>
<blockquote>“If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done”. – <strong>Bruce Lee</strong></blockquote>
<h2><strong>8. Stay inspired</strong></h2>
There will be times when you’ll ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing. Answer the question! <em><strong>Think of why you started your business and where you want to go.</strong></em>

Perhaps you had enough of your last job, wanted to earn more money so you could give the best to your kids, or wanted to make this world a better place. Whatever your reasons for starting your business, think of them and you’re sure to <strong><em>rediscover your inspiration.</em></strong>

Do take regular breaks and <em>reward yourself</em> for your achievements; <em>no matter how small they are.</em> Stay in touch with positive people and spend time with your family and loved ones. Also write a mission statement for your business, have it framed, and hang it where you can see it daily.
