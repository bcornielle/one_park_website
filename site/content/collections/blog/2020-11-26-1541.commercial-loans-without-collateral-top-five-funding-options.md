<p>Here's a sad truth: banks tend to assume that if you had a money problem once, you&rsquo;ll always be a bad financial risk. You can understand why they don&rsquo;t want to lend money to someone who may not repay it &ndash; you wouldn&rsquo;t want to take that chance either. That said, a bad credit score doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re a bad person. Healthcare bills, sudden family emergencies, rent increases or just an extended bad run of luck can create financial problems. And once you&rsquo;re in a hole, it can take a while to dig yourself out.</p>
<p>But how do you rebuild your business without capital to fund that growth?&nbsp;</p>
<H2>What You Need to Know About Collateral </H2>
<p>Besides a credit score of 700+, a bank is going to want <a href="https://www.oneparkfinancial.com/blog/do-i-need-collateral-to-get-a-business-loan">collateral</a>. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) defines collateral as "an additional form of security which can be used to assure a lender that you have a second source of loan repayment."</p>
<p>Collateral is something that the bank can sell to recoup its loss if you can&rsquo;t pay back your loan. Real estate, property, your business&rsquo; inventory or equipment, things of value that you own &ndash; such as a boat or vehicles or the money in a secured savings account qualify as collateral. Banks tend to prefer assets that can be easy converted to cash &ndash; so your bank account is going to be much more attractive than something they have to sell at auction.</p>
<p>Banks are also interested in collateral that will retain its value, and typically the value of collateral depreciates, or the lender may have to accept a lower price to liquidate it quickly. In general, as collateral, your assets are worth:</p>
<ul style="list-style:circle;padding-left:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<li>60% to 70% of the value of commercial real estate</li>
<li>50% of the value of resalable inventory (if there&rsquo;s no widespread market appeal for your inventory, the value as collateral will be much less)</li>
<li>40% of the value of equipment</li>
<li>30% of the value (or less) for technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re securing a loan with your inventory a $50,000 loan would require at least $100,000 in inventory as collateral. Banks value inventory differently though, and the collateral&rsquo;s worth depends on the type of inventory/property you have, and the current market for your collateral. And if your business is new, or is struggling financially, you&rsquo;ll have to provide more collateral than someone who has a profitable business that&rsquo;s been open for a few years, and a solid credit history.</p>
<p>Note that if you&rsquo;re financing specific assets such as equipment or technology, a loan can sometimes be secured by the assets you&rsquo;re financing. If you can&rsquo;t pay the loan, the assets are forfeit.</p>
<H2>Can I get a small business loan with no collateral?</H2>
<p>It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to get a traditional loan if you can&rsquo;t secure it with collateral. Realistically here are your options:</p>
<ul style="list-style:circle;padding-left:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
<li>Bad credit? Take a year or two and work to improve your score before you apply for a loan.</li>
<li>Borrow cash from family or friends to obtain a secured loan from your credit union or bank</li>
<li>Get a secured business credit card or line of credit and use that to fund your business</li>
<li>Apply for a peer-to-peer micro loan</li>
<li>Investigate alternative funding options</li>
</ol>
<H2>What is alternative funding for small businesses?</H2>
<p>But if you do need funding soon, then you&rsquo;ll want to look for sources that focus on your ability to pay now rather than your credit score. In general, applying for loans if you don&rsquo;t meet a lenders credit score requirements is a waste of time at best, and may actually end up lowering your credit score at worst. Instead look for funding sources that specify they will work with small business owners with bad credit.</p>
